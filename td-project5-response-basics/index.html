            <h1>History of the internet </h1>
            <p>Why was the internet created? In the 1950s and 60s, the United States was engaged in the Cold War with the Soviet Union. Each country was working to increase its science and technology capabilities in order to prevent nuclear attacks from the other, and also remain capable of attacking the other should the situation devolve. At that time, computers were much larger and more expensive than today's models. Mainframe computers took up entire rooms, and were only able to do specific tasks. Researchers needed to be able to use the computers to perform these tasks, but often had to travel long distances to find a computer to do a specific task. The proposed solution was a way to connect the computers so they could speak to each other, allowing researchers to share data without needing to travel to the location of the computer.<br><br>

                Mainframe computers were the first to be connected by the internet.<br><br>
                
                The internet began by connecting these mainframe computers.
                How was the internet created? The problem with having computers communicate with each other was that the method of transferring data from one computer to another, circuit switching, took a long time and could easily be interrupted. All of the data had to be sent in one packet, and if the connection was interrupted at any time during the process, none of the data would get through. Scientists developed a different method called packet switching to overcome this problem. With packet switching, the data could be broken up into smaller segments, and each segment could be sent individually. The smaller amounts of data took less time to transfer, and if an interruption occurred, some of the data would have made it through and the process could be continued without having to start over completely. Once the data reached its destination, the packets were able to be re-assembled into a complete packet</p>
